	abstract = {FFTW is an implementation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) that adapts to the hardware in order to maximize performance. This paper shows that such an approach can yield an implementation that is competitive with handoptimized libraries, and describes the software structure that makes our current FFTW3 version ﬂexible and adaptive. We further discuss a new algorithm for real-data DFTs of prime size, a new way of implementing DFTs by means of machine-speciﬁc “SIMD” instructions, and how a special-purpose compiler can derive optimized implementations of the discrete cosine and sine transforms automatically from a DFT algorithm.},

	abstract = {We present novel algorithms for computing discrete Fourier transforms with high performance on GPUs. We present hierarchical, mixed radix FFT algorithms for both power-of-two and non-power-of-two sizes. Our hierarchical FFT algorithms efﬁciently exploit shared memory on GPUs using a Stockham formulation. We reduce the memory transpose overheads in hierarchical algorithms by combining the transposes into a blockbased multi-FFT algorithm. For non-power-of-two sizes, we use a combination of mixed radix FFTs of small primes and Bluestein’s algorithm. We use modular arithmetic in Bluestein’s algorithm to improve the accuracy. We implemented our algorithms using the NVIDIA CUDA API and compared their performance with NVIDIA’s CUFFT library and an optimized CPU-implementation (Intel’s MKL) on a high-end quad-core CPU. On an NVIDIA GPU, we obtained performance of up to 300 GFlops, with typical performance improvements of 2–4× over CUFFT and 8–40× improvement over MKL for large sizes.},
